# CRITICAL: RAILWAY CACHE CLEARING REQUIRED

**Issue**: Railway serving stale HTML with outdated asset hashes  
**Status**: React app cannot load due to 404 JavaScript files  
**Timestamp**: July 22, 2025 6:45 PM

## Root Problem
- **Build Process**: Generates new asset hashes each time (BrNGetdQ, UCoUDbB9)
- **Railway Cache**: Serving old HTML referencing non-existent files (B6CnPaRo, CBze2JUE)  
- **Result**: JavaScript 404 errors prevent React from loading

## Evidence
1. Local build: `index-BrNGetdQ.js`
2. Railway HTML: `index-B6CnPaRo.js` (doesn't exist)
3. Browser gets 404 for JavaScript = blank page with only gradient

## Immediate Action Required
This commit forces Railway to clear its build cache and generate fresh HTML matching current asset hashes.

## Expected Result
- Railway will build fresh HTML with correct asset references
- React app will load successfully 
- Dashboard interface will be fully functional
- Automatic cookie extraction system accessible
