# Railway PostgreSQL Crash Diagnosis

## Common Causes of PostgreSQL Crashes on Railway

### 1. Memory Limits (Most Common)
- Railway free tier has strict memory limits
- PostgreSQL requires significant RAM for initialization
- Multiple services competing for limited resources

### 2. Connection Pool Exhaustion
- Too many simultaneous database connections
- Application not properly closing connections
- Drizzle ORM connection management issues

### 3. Resource Contention
- App and PostgreSQL running on same container resources
- CPU limits exceeded during startup
- Disk I/O constraints

### 4. Configuration Issues
- Improper DATABASE_URL format
- SSL/TLS connection problems
- Network timeout settings

## Immediate Fixes to Implement

### 1. Reduce Memory Usage
- Limit connection pool size
- Add connection timeout settings
- Implement proper connection cleanup

### 2. Optimize Database Operations
- Use connection pooling efficiently
- Implement retry logic with backoff
- Add graceful degradation

### 3. Railway Service Configuration
- Ensure PostgreSQL has dedicated resources
- Check service restart policies
- Verify environment variable propagation

## Expected Solutions
The fixes will address:
- Connection pool management
- Memory optimization
- Error handling improvements
- Railway-specific database configuration
