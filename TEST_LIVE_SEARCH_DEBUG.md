# Live Search Debug Analysis

## Progress Made:
✅ Build compiles successfully  
✅ performLiveSearch function is being called  
✅ Search completes with status "failed" and timestamp  
✅ No more infinite hanging searches  

## Current Issue:
The LiveSearchService is failing after ~12 seconds, which suggests:
1. Browser initialization is failing on Railway
2. Authentication step is failing  
3. Timeout during portal access

## Environment Considerations:
- **Local Environment**: Has browser access, different paths
- **Railway Environment**: Containerized, different browser paths, may lack browser dependencies

## Next Steps:
1. Add comprehensive debug logging to LiveSearchService
2. Test browser availability specifically on Railway 
3. Add fallback mechanisms for Railway environment
4. Ensure Railway has Chrome installed and accessible

## Key Finding:
The system architecture is now working correctly - the issue is specifically with browser automation in the Railway deployment environment, not with the search workflow itself.
