# Railway Comprehensive Debug Solution

## Critical Analysis
After multiple attempts, Railway is STILL showing "Port: 5000" in logs despite PORT environment variable fixes. This indicates either:
1. Railway is not setting PORT environment variable correctly
2. Server code is not properly reading Railway's PORT
3. Railway's load balancer is misconfigured

## Comprehensive Debug Strategy
1. **Enhanced Port Debugging**: Added detailed logging of ALL Railway environment variables
2. **Health Check Diagnostics**: Enhanced /health endpoint to return actual port and environment data
3. **Production Environment Detection**: Better Railway environment detection
4. **Request Debugging**: Log all health check requests to diagnose Railway's connection attempts

## Expected Debug Output
Next deployment will show:
- Exact PORT value Railway provides (or lack thereof)
- All Railway environment variables present
- Whether Railway is actually setting PORT correctly
- Health check request details from Railway's load balancer

## Resolution Strategy
If PORT is still undefined/5000:
- Railway may need PORT environment variable manually set in dashboard
- Alternative: Use Railway's internal networking configuration
- Fallback: Contact Railway support for platform-specific PORT handling

This comprehensive debugging will reveal the exact Railway networking issue preventing successful deployment.
