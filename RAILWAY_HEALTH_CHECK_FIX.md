# Railway Health Check Fix

## Critical Issue
Railway's load balancer is unable to connect to the application despite the server running correctly. The 502 "Application failed to respond" error indicates Railway's health check is failing.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Server starts successfully on port 5000
2. API endpoints work correctly (dashboard stats responding)
3. Railway's load balancer cannot connect to verify health
4. Health check may be timing out or hitting wrong endpoint

## Comprehensive Fix Applied
1. **Dedicated Health Check Endpoint**: Added `/health` endpoint specifically for Railway's load balancer
2. **Updated Railway Configuration**: Changed healthcheckPath from `/api/dashboard/stats` to `/health`
3. **Enhanced Server Error Handling**: Added explicit server startup error handling
4. **Simplified Health Response**: Lightweight response for faster health checks
5. **Port Debugging**: Added PORT environment variable logging for Railway diagnostics

## Expected Resolution
- Railway's health checks will pass using the dedicated `/health` endpoint
- Load balancer will correctly route traffic to the application
- Frontend will load properly instead of showing 502 errors
- Application will be fully accessible via Railway's public URL

This addresses Railway's specific networking requirements for successful deployment.
