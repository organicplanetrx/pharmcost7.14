# Railway PostgreSQL Connection Fix

## Issue Identified
PostgreSQL service is crashing on Railway, preventing database operations while the application server runs correctly.

## Common Railway PostgreSQL Issues

### 1. Database Service Not Properly Added
- Railway requires explicit PostgreSQL service addition
- Service must be linked to your application

### 2. Connection String Problems  
- DATABASE_URL environment variable may be missing or malformed
- Connection timeout issues in Railway's network environment

### 3. Database Initialization Issues
- Database schema not created on first deployment
- Missing migrations or table creation

## Diagnostic Steps

### Check Database Service Status
1. In Railway dashboard, verify PostgreSQL service is running
2. Check "Services" tab - you should see both your app AND PostgreSQL
3. Ensure DATABASE_URL environment variable is populated

### Verify Connection String Format
Railway DATABASE_URL should look like:
```
postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/database
```

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Verify PostgreSQL Service
```bash
# In Railway CLI
railway ps
# Should show both app and postgres services
```

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard Variables section, verify:
- `DATABASE_URL` exists and is populated automatically
- Format: `postgresql://postgres:...@...railway.app:5432/railway`

### Step 3: Database Schema Initialization
The application may need to create database tables on first run.

### Step 4: Connection Timeout Settings  
Railway may require longer connection timeouts for database initialization.

## Expected Fix Implementation

The application will be updated to:
1. Handle Railway PostgreSQL connection gracefully
2. Create database schema automatically if needed  
3. Provide better error logging for database connection issues
4. Fall back to memory storage if database is unavailable (temporarily)

## Railway-Specific Database Configuration

Railway PostgreSQL requires:
- SSL connection (usually handled automatically)
- Proper connection pooling
- Retry logic for intermittent connection issues
- Schema initialization on first deployment

## Post-Fix Verification

After implementing database fixes:
1. Check Railway logs for successful database connection
2. Verify health check endpoint returns proper data
3. Test credential storage and search functionality
4. Ensure pharmaceutical data persistence works correctly

The database connection should stabilize once these Railway-specific configurations are applied.
