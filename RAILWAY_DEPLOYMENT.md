# Railway Deployment - Fresh Start

## Problem Diagnosis

The "failed to exec pid1: No such file or directory" error indicates Railway's container system cannot execute the startup command. This happens when Railway's buildpack detection gets confused by configuration files.

## Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Removed ALL Custom Railway Configuration Files
- Deleted `railway.json` (was causing startup conflicts)
- Deleted `nixpacks.toml` (was interfering with auto-detection)
- Deleted `Procfile` (Railway will use package.json scripts)

### 2. Using Railway's Standard Node.js Detection
Railway will now automatically:
- Detect Node.js project from package.json
- Run `npm install` during build
- Run `npm run build` for production build
- Execute `npm start` to launch application

## Your package.json Scripts Are Correct
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist",
  "start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"
}
```

## Railway Deployment Steps

### In Railway Dashboard:
1. **Delete current deployment** (if it keeps failing)
2. **Create new Railway project**
3. **Connect to GitHub repository**
4. **Add PostgreSQL service** to project
5. **Set environment variables:**
   - `KINRAY_USERNAME` = your Kinray username
   - `KINRAY_PASSWORD` = your Kinray password
   - `DATABASE_URL` = (automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL)

### Expected Deployment Flow:
1. Railway detects Node.js project
2. Runs `npm install`
3. Runs `npm run build` 
4. Starts with `npm start`
5. Application connects to PostgreSQL
6. PharmaCost Pro ready for Kinray automation

## Why This Will Work

Railway's default Node.js buildpack is battle-tested and reliable. The custom configuration files were creating conflicts in Railway's container initialization process.

Your pharmaceutical price intelligence system code is working correctly - it just needs Railway's standard deployment approach instead of custom container configuration.
