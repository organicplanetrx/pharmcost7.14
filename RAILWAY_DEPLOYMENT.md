# Railway Deployment Guide for PharmaCost Pro

## Deployment Configuration

PharmaCost Pro is now optimized for Railway deployment with the following configurations:

### Files Added/Modified:
- `railway.json` - Railway-specific deployment configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration for Nixpacks
- `Procfile` - Process definition for Railway
- `.railwayignore` - Files to exclude from deployment

### Railway Environment Setup

#### Required Environment Variables:
Set these in your Railway project dashboard:

```bash
# Database (automatically provided by Railway PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Kinray Portal Credentials  
KINRAY_USERNAME=your_kinray_username
KINRAY_PASSWORD=your_kinray_password

# Production Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Optional Environment Variables:
```bash
# Custom port (Railway provides this automatically)
PORT=5000
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create Railway Project:**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway add postgresql
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Go to your Railway project dashboard
   - Navigate to Variables section
   - Add KINRAY_USERNAME and KINRAY_PASSWORD
   - DATABASE_URL is automatically provided

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

## Railway Advantages for PharmaCost Pro

### âœ… Benefits:
- **Automatic PostgreSQL Database**: No manual database setup required
- **Environment Variable Management**: Secure credential storage
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically  
- **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS enabled by default
- **Build Optimization**: Nixpacks handles Node.js builds efficiently
- **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring via `/api/dashboard/stats`
- **Browser Automation Support**: Full Chromium/Puppeteer compatibility

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features:
- **Nixpacks Build**: Optimized Node.js 20 runtime
- **Process Management**: Automatic restart on failures
- **Port Binding**: Railway PORT environment variable support
- **Static Asset Serving**: Efficient frontend delivery
- **API Health Monitoring**: Endpoint-based health checks

## Browser Automation on Railway

Railway supports Puppeteer/Chromium with the following optimizations:

```javascript
// Browser configuration for Railway
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new',
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
    '--disable-gpu',
    '--no-first-run',
    '--no-default-browser-check',
    '--disable-default-apps'
  ]
});
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify functionality:

1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/api/dashboard/stats`
2. **Database Connection**: Check dashboard stats load properly
3. **Browser Automation**: Test credential connection to Kinray portal
4. **Search Functionality**: Perform a medication search
5. **Results Display**: Verify pharmaceutical data appears correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Database Connection Errors:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is added to Railway project
- Verify DATABASE_URL is automatically populated

**Browser Automation Failures:**
- Check logs for Puppeteer initialization errors
- Verify Kinray credentials are correctly set

**Build Failures:**
- Review nixpacks.toml configuration
- Check Node.js version compatibility (20.x)

**Static Asset Issues:**
- Verify build command completes successfully
- Check dist/public/ directory is created

## Monitoring and Logs

Access deployment logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

Monitor application metrics:
- Railway dashboard provides CPU/memory usage
- Health check endpoint: `/api/dashboard/stats`
- Search activity logs available in application

## Security Considerations

- Kinray credentials stored securely in Railway environment variables
- HTTPS enforced by default
- Database connection uses SSL
- Browser automation runs in sandboxed environment
- No sensitive data logged or exposed

## Performance Optimization

Railway deployment includes:
- Build caching for faster deployments
- Automatic resource scaling based on demand
- CDN-like static asset delivery
- Efficient browser process management
- Database connection pooling
