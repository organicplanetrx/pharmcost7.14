# Railway Frontend Fix Applied

## Issue Diagnosed
- Backend server running perfectly on port 5000
- Docker build completing successfully with all static files
- Frontend showing "Application failed to respond" due to static file path issue

## Fix Implemented
Enhanced static file serving in `server/index.ts` to properly locate and serve the React build files from the correct `dist/public/` directory on Railway.

## What Changed
- Added proper static file path resolution for Railway deployment
- Enhanced error logging to diagnose static file location issues  
- Implemented fallback to existing vite.ts serving if needed
- Added client-side routing support for React Router

## Expected Results After Deployment
1. **Homepage loads**: React pharmaceutical dashboard appears correctly
2. **API endpoints work**: Backend already confirmed working
3. **Client routing**: React navigation works properly
4. **Static assets**: CSS, JS, images load from correct paths

The Railway deployment should now serve your PharmaCost Pro frontend correctly once this update is deployed.
