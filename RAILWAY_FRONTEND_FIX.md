# RAILWAY FRONTEND LOADING FIX

**Issue**: Railway serving blank page due to asset hash mismatch  
**Status**: Fixed locally, triggering Railway redeploy  
**Timestamp**: July 22, 2025 6:12 PM

## Root Cause
- HTML index.html referencing outdated asset hashes
- Build artifacts not synchronized with HTML references
- Static file serving working but files don't exist

## Solution Applied
1. Complete dist/ directory cleanup
2. Fresh build with synchronized asset hashes
3. Verified HTML references match built assets
4. Static file serving configured correctly

## Expected Result After Deployment
- React frontend loads correctly at https://pharmcost714-production.up.railway.app/
- Professional pharmaceutical dashboard interface visible
- Automatic cookie extraction interface available
- All API endpoints functional
