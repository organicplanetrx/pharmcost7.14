# PharmaCost Pro - Alternative Deployment Solutions

## Current Issue
DigitalOcean Node.js buildpack doesn't allow system package installation (no root access), preventing Chrome browser dependencies from being installed. Browser downloads successfully but fails to launch due to missing `libnss3.so` and other system libraries.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)
**Platforms**: DigitalOcean App Platform (Docker), Google Cloud Run, AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances

**Benefits**:
- Full control over system dependencies
- Guaranteed Chrome browser support
- Consistent environment across deployments

**Implementation**: Create Dockerfile with Chrome dependencies pre-installed.

### Option 2: Railway Platform
**Status**: Previously attempted but had load balancer issues
**Retry Recommendation**: Railway may have fixed networking issues since July 2025

### Option 3: Render Platform
**Status**: Previously configured but needs retry with latest browser fixes
**Benefits**: Good Node.js support, may allow system packages

### Option 4: Fly.io
**Benefits**: Full Docker support, excellent for browser automation
**Deployment**: Use Docker approach with Chrome dependencies

### Option 5: Vercel with Puppeteer
**Limitations**: Serverless functions have limitations for long-running browser automation
**Alternative**: Use Vercel's built-in Chrome support if available

## Immediate Action Required
The browser automation system is complete and working locally. The issue is purely deployment environment limitations. Moving to a Docker-based deployment or platform with full system access will resolve this immediately.

## Current Status
- ✅ Browser automation code working perfectly
- ✅ Browser downloads successfully 
- ✅ All fallback systems operational
- ❌ Missing system dependencies in current platform
- ❌ No root access to install Chrome libraries

## Next Steps
1. Choose Docker deployment approach
2. Create Dockerfile with Chrome dependencies
3. Deploy to Docker-compatible platform
4. Test live pharmaceutical portal automation
