# Railway 502 Error Fix

## Issue Identified
Server is running correctly and health checks are working locally, but Railway edge returns 502 "Application failed to respond". This indicates Railway's load balancer can't connect to the application despite the server running on the correct port.

## Root Cause
Railway's PORT environment variable may not be properly configured or the health check settings need adjustment for the container environment.

## Fixes Applied
1. **Enhanced PORT Configuration**: Added explicit PORT logging and Railway environment detection
2. **Updated railway.toml**: Added healthcheckInterval and explicit PORT variable
3. **Dockerfile Enhancement**: Set default PORT=5000 environment variable
4. **Improved Logging**: Added PORT debugging for Railway troubleshooting

## Expected Resolution
- Railway's load balancer will properly connect to the application
- Health checks will pass correctly
- Frontend will load instead of showing 502 errors
- Application will be accessible via Railway's public URL

The server logs confirm everything is working correctly - this fix addresses Railway's specific deployment networking requirements.
