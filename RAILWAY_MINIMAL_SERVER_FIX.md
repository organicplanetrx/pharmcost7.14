# Railway Minimal Server Fix

## Final Diagnosis
After multiple attempts, Railway is still showing old logs with "Port: 5000", suggesting:
1. Railway might be caching old deployments
2. Environment variables aren't being set correctly 
3. Health check timing issues on startup

## Comprehensive Railway-Specific Solution
Created a completely Railway-optimized deployment strategy:

### 1. Railway Server Wrapper (`railway-server.js`)
- Dedicated Railway environment detection
- Comprehensive environment variable debugging  
- Proper error handling for Railway platform
- Imports the main application after Railway setup

### 2. Process File (`Procfile`)
- Direct Railway process configuration
- Bypasses npm script complications
- Uses Railway-optimized entry point

### 3. Updated Dockerfile
- Uses Railway server wrapper as entry point
- Eliminates npm start script issues

## Expected Results
This minimal approach will:
- Show exact Railway environment variables in logs
- Reveal if PORT is being set correctly by Railway
- Eliminate any npm script interference
- Provide cleaner Railway deployment process

If Railway still shows PORT=5000 after this deployment, it confirms Railway platform issue requiring manual PORT configuration in Railway dashboard.
