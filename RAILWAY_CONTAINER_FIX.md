# Railway Container Initialization Fix

## The Real Problem

The error "failed to exec pid1: No such file or directory" indicates Railway cannot execute the container startup command. This is NOT a PostgreSQL issue - it's a container configuration problem.

## Root Cause Analysis

From the logs, Railway is repeatedly failing to start the application container:
- Container mounts successfully 
- But fails to execute the main process (pid1)
- This suggests the startup command or script path is incorrect

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified Railway Configuration
- Removed complex `railway.json` configurations that may confuse Railway
- Let Railway use its default Node.js detection
- Removed custom health checks and restart policies

### 2. Fixed Procfile Command
- Changed from `npm run start` to `npm start` (standard convention)
- Railway expects standard npm scripts

### 3. Removed Custom Start Script
- Deleted `start.sh` which Railway couldn't find or execute
- Using direct Node.js execution via package.json scripts

### 4. Eliminated Configuration Conflicts
- Simplified `nixpacks.toml` to let Railway auto-detect
- Removed custom build commands that might interfere

## Expected Result

After redeployment, Railway should:
1. Auto-detect Node.js application
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run build`  
3. Execute `npm start` to launch your app
4. PostgreSQL service should connect normally

## Why This Wasn't Your Fault

Railway's container system is sensitive to configuration conflicts. The complex setup I created was causing Railway to look for files that didn't exist or weren't executable in the container environment.

The simplified approach follows Railway's standard Node.js deployment pattern, which should resolve the "pid1" startup failures.

Your pharmaceutical price intelligence system should now deploy successfully on Railway.
