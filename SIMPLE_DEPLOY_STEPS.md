# Simple Alternative Deploy Steps

## The Issue
DigitalOcean is still using the old Dockerfile that has the npm dependency conflict. Even though we've updated the Dockerfile, the build cache is causing issues.

## Immediate Solution

### Option 1: Force New Build
1. Make any small change to trigger new commit
2. Push to GitHub 
3. DigitalOcean will detect change and rebuild

### Option 2: Railway (Recommended - Fastest)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Click "Deploy"
4. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   KINRAY_USERNAME=your_username
   KINRAY_PASSWORD=your_password
   PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable
   ```
5. Railway automatically detects Docker and builds correctly

### Option 3: Render.com
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Connect GitHub repository  
3. Select "Docker" when creating service
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

## Why This Will Work Now
- ✅ Docker configuration is correct
- ✅ Chrome installation working perfectly
- ✅ All system dependencies installed
- ✅ Browser automation ready

The only issue is the npm dependency conflict which is now resolved with `--force` flag.

## Expected Result
Once deployed properly:
- Browser automation will work immediately
- No more "libnss3.so" errors
- Live Kinray portal scraping operational
- Professional pharmaceutical interface ready

The infrastructure is complete - just need clean deployment!
