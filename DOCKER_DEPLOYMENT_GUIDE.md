# PharmaCost Pro - Docker Deployment Guide

## The Solution

I've created a complete Docker setup that will end the deployment struggles. This includes:

1. **Dockerfile** - Pre-installs Chrome and all dependencies
2. **docker-compose.yml** - Complete deployment configuration  
3. **Simplified browser code** - Works with Docker environment

## Deploy on DigitalOcean (Docker Option)

### Step 1: Change Build Method
In your DigitalOcean App Platform:
1. Go to your app settings
2. Change from "Node.js" to "Docker"
3. Set build source to "Dockerfile"

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in DigitalOcean:
```
NODE_ENV=production
KINRAY_USERNAME=your_username
KINRAY_PASSWORD=your_password
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable
```

### Step 3: Deploy
The Docker build will:
- Install Google Chrome and all dependencies
- Set up the Node.js environment
- Build the application
- Start the server

## Alternative: Quick Local Test

Run these commands to test locally:
```bash
docker build -t pharmcost-pro .
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e KINRAY_USERNAME=your_username -e KINRAY_PASSWORD=your_password pharmcost-pro
```

## Why This Will Work

1. **Full system control** - Docker gives us root access to install Chrome
2. **Pre-installed dependencies** - All Chrome libraries included in the image
3. **Simplified browser code** - Uses pre-installed Chrome instead of downloads
4. **Proven approach** - This is how professional apps handle browser automation

## What Changes

The browser automation will now:
1. Detect Docker environment
2. Use pre-installed Chrome at `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`
3. Skip all the download/installation complexity
4. Launch immediately and work

This approach eliminates all the system dependency issues we've been fighting.
