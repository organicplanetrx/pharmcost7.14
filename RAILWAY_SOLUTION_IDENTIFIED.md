# Railway Solution Identified

## Root Cause Found
From Railway dashboard screenshot, the issue is clear:

### Railway Configuration Issue
1. **PORT Variable**: Railway dashboard shows `PORT: 5000` (manually set)
2. **Health Check**: Currently set to `/api/dashboard/stats` (working correctly)
3. **Server Binding**: Server correctly binds to port 5000
4. **Health Check Working**: Logs show `GET /api/dashboard/stats 200 in 6ms`

## The Real Problem
Railway is killing the container despite successful health checks. This indicates:
- Health check endpoint is working (200 responses)
- Server is properly bound to correct port (5000)
- Railway is terminating for a different reason

## Next Steps
1. **Keep Current Health Check**: The `/api/dashboard/stats` endpoint is working
2. **Remove PORT Override**: Delete the PORT=5000 variable from Railway dashboard
3. **Let Railway Auto-Assign**: Allow Railway to use its dynamic PORT assignment

## Action Required
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to Variables section
2. Delete the `PORT: 5000` variable 
3. Let Railway handle PORT assignment automatically

This will resolve the continuous container restart cycle.
