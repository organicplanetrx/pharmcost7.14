# Railway PostgreSQL Service Fix

## PostgreSQL Service Crash Diagnosis

Since your main application (pharmcost7.14) is deploying successfully, the issue is specifically with the PostgreSQL service configuration or resource limits on Railway.

## Common PostgreSQL Crash Causes on Railway

### 1. Memory Limits Exceeded
Railway free tier has strict memory limits. PostgreSQL initialization requires significant RAM.

### 2. Disk Space Issues
PostgreSQL needs adequate disk space for data files and WAL logs.

### 3. Configuration Problems
- Improper postgresql.conf settings for Railway environment
- Connection limits too high for available resources
- Shared memory configuration issues

### 4. Resource Contention
- Multiple services competing for limited Railway resources
- CPU throttling during PostgreSQL startup

## Railway PostgreSQL Service Fixes

### Step 1: Check Railway PostgreSQL Service Settings
1. In Railway dashboard, go to PostgreSQL service
2. Check Variables tab - ensure no custom config overriding defaults
3. Remove any custom POSTGRES_* environment variables that might conflict
4. Let Railway use default PostgreSQL configuration

### Step 2: Verify Resource Allocation
1. Ensure PostgreSQL service has dedicated resources (not shared with app)
2. Check if you're hitting Railway free tier limits
3. Consider upgrading to Railway Pro if hitting resource constraints

### Step 3: Database Connection String
Ensure your application connects with Railway's auto-generated DATABASE_URL format:
```
postgresql://postgres:password@hostname:port/railway
```

### Step 4: Fresh PostgreSQL Service
If crashes persist:
1. Delete current PostgreSQL service in Railway
2. Add new PostgreSQL service to project
3. Wait for it to initialize completely before connecting application
4. Copy new DATABASE_URL to application environment variables

## Expected PostgreSQL Behavior
When working correctly, Railway PostgreSQL logs should show:
```
PostgreSQL Database directory appears to contain a database
LOG: database system is ready to accept connections
```

Your PharmaCost Pro application should then connect successfully and create the necessary pharmaceutical data tables.
