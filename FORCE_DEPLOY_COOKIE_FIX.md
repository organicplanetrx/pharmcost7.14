# FORCE DEPLOYMENT: Cookie Extraction Fix

**Issue**: Railway deployment still using old cookie extraction code with invalid CSS selectors
**Status**: Fixed locally, needs deployment refresh
**Timestamp**: July 22, 2025 5:53 PM

## Changes Made
- Fixed CSS selector syntax removing `:contains()` pseudo-selectors
- Enhanced form field detection with multiple selector strategies  
- Improved TypeScript type safety and error handling
- Added comprehensive button detection logic

## Expected Result After Deployment
- Automatic cookie extraction should work without CSS selector errors
- Enhanced login form detection with multiple fallback strategies
- Better error messages for debugging authentication issues

## Verification Steps
1. Test /api/extract-cookies endpoint with valid credentials
2. Verify browser automation launches correctly
3. Check login form detection logs
4. Confirm cookie extraction and injection workflow
