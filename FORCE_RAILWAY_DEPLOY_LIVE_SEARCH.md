# Force Railway Deployment - Live Search Implementation

## Critical Update Required

Railway deployment needs to be updated with the new LiveSearchService implementation that replaces cookie injection with direct credential-based authentication.

## Key Changes:

1. **New LiveSearchService**: Direct credential-based authentication for each search
2. **Eliminated Cookie Dependency**: No more reliance on session cookies that expire
3. **Fresh Login Per Search**: Performs real authentication each time instead of cookie injection
4. **Improved Reliability**: Direct portal access with real credentials

## Deployment Status:

- Local build: ✅ Complete
- Code push required: ✅ Ready  
- Railway deployment: ⏳ Pending

The system is now configured to use `performLiveSearch()` instead of the cookie-based approach. This should resolve the authentication and timeout issues.

Railway needs to rebuild with the latest code containing:
- `server/services/live-search-service.ts` 
- Updated `server/routes.ts` with `performLiveSearch()` function
- Eliminated cookie injection dependencies

## Expected Result:
- Live pharmaceutical searches with fresh Kinray authentication
- No more session cookie expiration issues  
- Direct portal access using real credentialsDeployment timestamp: Tue Jul 22 07:57:35 PM UTC 2025
