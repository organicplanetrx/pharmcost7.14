# RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUE

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Railway deployment is not syncing with local builds
**Status**: Asset hash mismatch causing React app to fail loading
**Timestamp**: July 22, 2025 6:25 PM

## Problem Analysis
- **Local Build**: Generates new hashes on each build (e.g., index-C7Z6enVR.js)
- **Railway Serving**: Old hashes from previous deployment (e.g., index-B6CnPaRo.js)
- **Root Cause**: Railway not picking up latest build artifacts from Git

## Evidence
1. Local `dist/public/index.html` references: `index-C7Z6enVR.js`
2. Railway serving HTML with: `index-B6CnPaRo.js` 
3. JavaScript file 404s because files don't match
4. User sees purple gradient background but no React content

## Immediate Solution
Deploy current stable build with verified asset synchronization.
Railway auto-deploy should pick up this commit within 2-3 minutes.

## Verification Steps After Deployment
1. Check HTML asset references match actual files in /assets/
2. Verify React app mounts and dashboard loads
3. Test automatic cookie extraction interface
4. Confirm all API endpoints functional
