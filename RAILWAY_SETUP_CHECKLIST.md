# Railway Deployment Checklist for PharmaCost Pro

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Setup Complete

### Configuration Files Added:
- [x] `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration with health checks
- [x] `nixpacks.toml` - Node.js 20 build configuration
- [x] `Procfile` - Process definition for Railway
- [x] `.railwayignore` - Optimized file exclusions for deployment

### Code Optimizations:
- [x] Railway environment detection in browser automation
- [x] Multiple Chrome/Chromium path fallbacks for Railway containers
- [x] Production-optimized server startup logging
- [x] Storage singleton pattern fixed for consistent data persistence

## üöÄ Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Project
```bash
railway login
railway init
railway add postgresql
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard
```bash
# Required - Kinray Portal Credentials
KINRAY_USERNAME=your_kinray_username_here
KINRAY_PASSWORD=your_kinray_password_here

# Automatically provided by Railway
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Deploy Application
```bash
railway up
```

## üîß Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks:
1. **Application Status**: Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/api/dashboard/stats`
2. **Database Connection**: Verify stats load without errors
3. **Frontend Interface**: Check React application loads properly
4. **Credential Testing**: Test Kinray portal connection via credentials page
5. **Search Functionality**: Perform medication search (e.g., "lisinopril")
6. **Results Display**: Verify pharmaceutical data appears in frontend

### Expected Responses:
- Health endpoint should return: `{"totalSearchesToday":0,"totalCostAnalysis":"0.00","csvExportsGenerated":0}`
- Search should return: `{"searchId":1}` then progress to completed status
- Results should include authentic Kinray pricing data with NDC codes

## üè• Pharmaceutical Features Ready

### Live Portal Integration:
- [x] Kinray (Cardinal Health) portal authentication
- [x] Real-time medication price extraction
- [x] Authentic NDC code capture
- [x] Manufacturer and package size data
- [x] Availability status tracking

### Professional Interface:
- [x] Modern pharmaceutical-themed UI with purple gradient
- [x] Credential management with secure storage
- [x] Real-time search status updates
- [x] Professional results table with sorting
- [x] CSV export functionality for analysis

## üîê Security Considerations

### Environment Variables:
- Kinray credentials stored securely in Railway environment
- Database connection string automatically encrypted
- No sensitive data exposed in logs or client code

### Browser Automation:
- Sandboxed browser processes
- Secure credential handling
- No credential persistence in browser memory

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Railway Dashboard Access:
- Real-time application metrics
- Build and deployment logs
- Database performance monitoring
- Environment variable management

### Application Logging:
```bash
railway logs --tail
```

### Health Monitoring:
